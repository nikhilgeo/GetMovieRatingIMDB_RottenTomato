# Movie-Oracle

1 TB HDD full of Hollywood movies, and want to watch a movie out of it. 
Yep to find that exact movie which got a decent IMDB and Rottentomato rating it's a nightmare, just like finding a needle out of hay stack.

This is my attempt to speed things up and find that movie to watch.

This is Python script to retrieve IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes rating and details for movies in a Folder.
Script will traverse into the folders recursively to find the files.
OMDB API is used to query IMDB and Rottentomato details.

How to Run:
Run the script from a folder having movie files.
python3.4 launchpad.py

The movie rating will be displayed on screen and a handy CSV file will be created in the same folder with the name "MovieRating.csv"
